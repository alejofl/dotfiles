# Dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files and some scripts to streamline the setup of a new machine.

All of the scripts and config files are aimed at macOS, but some of them may work on other Unix-like systems.

## Execution

* Install all apps and tools, configure ZSH and Git:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```
